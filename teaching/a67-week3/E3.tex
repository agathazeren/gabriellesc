\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute\marginpar{[2]} the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(3x-2)^{13}$.
\item A\marginpar{[3]} computer generates a random four-digit string in the symbols A, B, C, \ldots, Z.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item How many such strings are possible?
	\item What is the probability that the random string contains no vowels (A, E, I, O, U)?
	\end{enumerate}
\item If\marginpar{[2]} you roll two six-sided dice, what is the probability of rolling a 7 (as their sum)?
\item If\marginpar{[2]} you roll two four-sided dice (with numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4), what is the probability of rolling a 5?\\[1ex]
\textit{(Just for fun: can you draw a four-sided die?)}
\item A rook\marginpar{[5]} is a chess piece that attacks other pieces by moving horizontally or vertically. How many ways can you place $n>0$ rooks on a chessboard so that no two attack each other, if
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item all the rooks are identical?
	\item you have 4 wooden and 4 marble rooks?
	\item all the rooks are different?
	\end{enumerate}
For example, here are 5 nonattacking rooks on a chessboard:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6]
\foreach \x in {0,...,7}
	\foreach \y in {0,...,7}
		\node[draw,rectangle,minimum size=0.6cm] at (\x cm,\y cm) {};
\foreach \x in {0,2,...,7}
	\foreach \y in {0,2,...,7}
		\node[draw,rectangle,minimum size=0.6cm,fill=gray] at (\x cm,\y cm) {};
\foreach \x in {1,3,...,7}
	\foreach \y in {1,3,...,7}
		\node[draw,rectangle,minimum size=0.6cm,fill=gray] at (\x cm,\y cm) {};

\pgfdeclareimage[height=0.6cm]{rook}{rook.png};

\draw[->,red,thick] (3cm,6cm) -- (2cm,6cm);

\node at (1cm,0cm) {\pgfuseimage{rook}};
\node at (3cm,6cm) {\pgfuseimage{rook}};
\node at (0cm,4cm) {\pgfuseimage{rook}};
\node at (5cm,3cm) {\pgfuseimage{rook}};
\node at (6cm,2cm) {\pgfuseimage{rook}};
